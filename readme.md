# Unlock

Unlock is a highly experimental extension for your browser that enables you to not just read from the web, but write to it as well. This is achieved by giving the extension access to one of your S3 blob storage compatible access tokens and an LLM token for page generation. From here, the interface is primarily driven from a side panel and uses the Tab Groups API to keep everything tidy.

While this extension seeks to leverage LLMs it is not about having agents surfing the web for you or chatting in a sidebar about your web experience. It is simply about generating HTML pages from natural language. This extension is fundamentally about restoring access and agency to the web. We want more people buiding more things on the web, especially for themselves. 

This extension is experimental in the sense that it will solve none of your problems. However, it might drive inspiration and restore some faith that we can still evolve the web before it gets swallowed by AI agents. And depending on who you are and what you value, that might be solving a problem in your life. If you care about the open web and that sort of thing.

This extension is in very active development. All settings and user data is stored locally inside the extension. Assume all of your data could be corrupt or break when you decide to update. This is just for messing around.
